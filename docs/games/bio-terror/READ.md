## Story

There is an American military force. There is an opposing terrorist team (Russians)...  The objective of the American
forces it to always have a supply of bioweapon-A and bioweapon-B in stock.  Do to that requirement the American force is
required to occasionally run an errand and retreve a bioweapon-A/B container to keep fresh stock in the military base.
Terrorist forces want to take the American bioweapon and use it for their own purposes.  This requires an intercept of
both bioweapon transports... or stealing the bioweapon components directly from the American base.  Either way... it is
a fight for the terrorists.


## Hardware
This requires 2 Milsim-Prop-Alpha1 devices.  One for the Americans and one for the terrorist force.  Both devices will
be plugged into the bioweapon-freezer units (additional hardware).  The game requires multiple (2 each color) bioweapon
containers which safely contain and transport the bio-weapon components.  Bioweapon components can be put in the
terrorist's biofreezer to create the bioweapon and win the game. But each bioweapon container is only "good" for a short
span of time.  The bio container must be placed into a biofreezer before its short timespan expires.  The military base's
biofreezer is able to lengthen the time before a bioweapon containers containment fails and destroys the bio-agent.
Some 3D Design has been done for the prop which for the bio-freezer is based on a 
[Plano 68 quart container](https://www.amazon.com/Plano-1719-00-Quart-Tote-Black/dp/B07YBN51BY/) with Red / Blue 
biocomponent storage. There also exists a hardware hack method. Which allows the terrorist unit to open the American 
military's bioagent-A or bioagent-B side based upon which wires are cut. Can they figure it out?



## Gameplay
The American Military force must keep supplies of both bioweapon components in stock in order to keep the world order
intact.  Terrorist force wants to 1) prevent American military from having both bioweapon components in stock at the same
time (thus making America weak), or 2) obtain their own bioweapon from interception of the American bioweapon transports.
